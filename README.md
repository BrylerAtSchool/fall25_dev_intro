# fall25_dev_intro

Good afternoon everyone! Welcome to the introductory repository for CSC2510. 

This is an example of a README file - you're used to reading my assignment pages in Markdown, so you'll be experts at writing these! 

## To-Do 

1. I want you all to clone this repo to your local machine. You can accomplish this through the GUI by copying the URL (at the top of the page), and press the *Clone Repository* button.  
    a. Another way to accomplish this is CLI Git, running `git clone {url}`

2. Next, I want you all to change something in either the CSS or HTML. Add your name, change the colors, whatever you feel like. 

3. Now, return to Github Desktop (or do `git status`). You should see the changes listed on the left side.

4. To save these changes, we'll want to **commit** them. Down at the bottom left, you'll see a box containing summary and description.

5. Just like comments in code, ***please*** write good commit messages. I saw a capstone group who's commits were "fixed" and "update".

6. Finally, push the changes! If you've attached the repository to your Github account, you'll see it added onto your profile! 

- Note: Github and Git are two different things. Git is the software used for version control, while Github is software as a service (SaaS). Depending on how you use Github (deployment/hosting), it may be closer to infrastructure as a service (SaaS), or Platform as a service (PaaS).
